RM complaints management

URL : http://ancient-river-2069.herokuapp.com/#/

Improvements that can be done:
- User authentication (and session management) not implemented
- User id is hardcoded for creation of appointment. Instead it would be good idea to take it from the user session context
- Changing the complaint status is not implemented (API exists however)
- Comments : additional of comments not implemented (API exists however)
- Load of the webpage will be slow as i have not minified/concatenated the files
